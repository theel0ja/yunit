Building yunit
==============

Only Ubuntu 17.04 (zesty) is supported as a development environment.

download source
---------------
  ```
  $ cd ~
  fetch yunit
  $ sudo apt-get install git
  $ git clone https://github.com/yunit-io/yunit.git
  $ cd ~/yunit
  ```

install dependencies and build yunit
------------------------------------
  ```
  $ sudo apt install devscripts equivs cmake
  $ ./build.sh
  ```

  If its your first time, this will install the required dependencies to build and
  build it.

  You might want to also install unity-scope-home and unity-scope-click which
  are technically "recommends", not strict dependencies

You may also rebuild with the -c for clean, which just deletes the build
directory.

build packages
--------------
  ```
  $ dpkg-buildpackage -us -uc -j$[`nproc` + 1]
  ```
This should compile remaining files and build `.deb` packages.

Installing yunit on your desktop
================================
  ```
  cd ~
  ```
  Ensure that there are no debs in your home folder, except those generated by the previous command
  ```
  $ sudo dpkg -i *.deb
  $ sudo apt install -f
  ```
First command in most cases will fail due to lack of dependencies, second one downloads them and installs previous packages.

Running yunit on your desktop without installing
================================================
````
cd ~/yunit
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/qt5/plugins/platforms/ builddir/src/unity8  -mousetouch
````
#### TODO
Seems that if you don't manually modify the LD_LIBRARY_PATH, it cannot find the `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/qt5/plugins/platforms/libqpa-mirserver.so` library. This needs to be fixed.

Notes
-----
- to navigate, utilize the mouse left button as you would your finger
- a three point drag (for side stage operations) can be performed by using
  the Shift+Control+Alt (all together) keyboard modifiers while using the mouse.
- to get the translations work, currently you have to do make install to
  put the *.mo files into correct structure. We'll look for a better solution
  later.
  `$ cd builddir; make install`
- if you wish to populate contacts
  ```
  $ sudo apt-get install gir1.2-ebook-1.2
  $ manage-address-book.py create
  ```
  this will:
    - Create an EDS address book
    - Populate the address book with sample data


Running yunit on devices
============================

Running yunit on a device should be done using crossbuilder.
Go to 
* https://launchpad.net/crossbuilder and
* https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Touch/Crossbuilder 
for more details on crossbuilder.

yunit will automatically restart on the phone once deployment
has finished due to post-build-steps set up in this repository.

Coding guidelines
=================

TBD

Development Environment
=======================

QtCreator (available via the Software Center) is the best IDE to hack on
yunit.

If using VIM, make sure you install some syntax highlighting for QML, like
https://github.com/peterhoeg/vim-qml

Running tests
=============

Tests are run from the build directory (which will be `./builddir` if you used
the `./build.sh` script).

To run the tests that do not require any graphical capability and therefore
are pretty fast run:

`$ make test`

or, alternatively:

`$ ctest`

To run all graphical tests, which can take a couple of minutes:

`$ make uitests`

To run the tests for a single component/class:

`$ make testComponentName`

So, for the DragHandle component that would be:

`$ make testDragHandle`

To run the tests for a single component/class under gdb (so you can catch SEGFAULTS)

`$ make gdbtestComponentName`

To run a single test function of a single component/class:

`$ make testComponentName FUNCTION="TestCaseName::functionName"`

To run a test application that allow you to manually test or to simply try out
a given component:

`$ make tryComponentName`

So to try out, for instance, the DragHandle component, you would do:

`$ make tryDragHandle`

NB: Manual test or interation doesn't make sense for all components or classes,
particularly the non-graphical ones. In such cases no "tryFoo" make target is
provided.

Running autopilot tests
=======================

Autopilot tests are run from the build directory (which will be ./builddir if you used
the ./build.sh script).

`$ make autopilot`

If you want you can also run tests individually, for that you need to install first,
otherwise the tests will run on the system-installed version

`$ make install`

To see the list of existing autopilot tests you can do

`$ PYTHONPATH=../tests/autopilot autopilot3 list unity8`

And then run a single test with

`$ PYTHONPATH=../tests/autopilot autopilot3 run unity8.some.very.long.test.name`

or run them all with

`$ PYTHONPATH=../tests/autopilot autopilot3 run unity8`

Debugging techniques
====================

yunit heavily uses Qt and with that Qt debugging techniques mostly apply in the
same fashion. There are, however, some additional unity8-specific notes:

* Enable/disable Qt scenegraph visualizer on the fly:

  `$ qdbus com.canonical.Unity8.Debugging /com/canonical/Unity8/Debugging SetSceneGraphVisualizer <mode>`

  This is equivalent to exporting QSG_VISUALIZE=<mode> before running unity8, except it does it on the
  fly.

* Toggle slow animations on the fly:

  `$ qdbus com.canonical.Unity8.Debugging /com/canonical/Unity8/Debugging SetSlowAnimations <true|false>`

* Change logging filter rules on the fly:

  `$ qdbus com.canonical.Unity8.Debugging /com/canonical/Unity8/Debugging SetLoggingFilterRules <filter>`

  This is equivalent to exporting QT_LOGGING_RULES or defining them in QT_LOGGING_CONF, except it does
  it on the fly.
