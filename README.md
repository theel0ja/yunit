# Yunit

This is a fork of Canonical's **Unity 8** repository as of April 5, 2017. Following [Mark Shuttleworth's announcement](https://insights.ubuntu.com/2017/04/05/growing-ubuntu-for-cloud-and-iot-rather-than-phone-and-convergence/)  to abandon Unity 8 development, **we are planning to continue working with the project.**

Please check [yunit's web site](http://www.yunit.io) (currently under construction) for project updates
 
**See the file [CODING.md](https://github.com/yunit-io/yunit/blob/master/CODING.md) for build and running instructions**
